[ ] Debug draw the voxel data
    This is important in order to debug import/export + any potential tree structure errors

[ ] Create psuedo code for extracting voxel lcoation from shader pixel position

========================================

[x] Draw up a memory layout diagram, needs to be clear how the data is to be read from the textures

[x] list vertices on selected mesh

[x] Produce some form of voxel data
    [x] Voxel Color
    [x] Voxel Normal

[x] Convert voxel data to tree structure

[x] Save voxel data to some shader-readable format, e.g texture data

[x] Decide on shader env/program, best candidate is probably shader monkey or Unity
