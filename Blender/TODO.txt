[x] list vertices on selected mesh

[x] Produce some form of voxel data
    [x] Voxel Color
    [x] Voxel Normal

[ ] Debug draw the voxel data
    This is important in order to debug import/export + any potential tree structure errors

[ ] Convert voxel data to tree structure

[ ] Save voxel data to some shader-readable format, e.g texture data

[ ] Decide on shader env/program, best candidate is probably shader monkey or Unity
